# Protostar

These are solutions to the exercises on the protostar iso with vulnerable binaries originally found on exploit-exercises.com which as of the time of writing is not available anymore. However, I managed to use the way back machine to retreive the iso.

The exercises work to cultivate working knowledge in buffer overflow, format string attacks etc

The solutions are done in the VM but I have documented the one liners as shell scripts in this repo and labeled each script according to the name of the binary that it exploits.
